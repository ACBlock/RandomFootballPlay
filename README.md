# RandomFootballPlay

In it's finished state, this should be able to generate a list of random football plays, and feed them into a simulator that will create stats for the various play types. It will then return "the ideal football play".

In its current state, this is pretty well borked. I'll come back to this as I have time. I have a few things in life that will need to be finished before I look at this again, so probably no updates until summer or so.
