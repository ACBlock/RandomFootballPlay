# RandomFootballPlay

In it's finished state, this should be able to generate a list of random football plays, and feed them into a simulator that will create stats for the various play types. It will then return "the ideal football play". The logic I use for this can be found here: https://acblock.github.io/2020-09-13-Random-Offense/

In its current state, this is pretty well borked. I'll come back to this as I have time. I have a few things in life that will need to be finished before I look at this again, so probably no updates until summer or so.
